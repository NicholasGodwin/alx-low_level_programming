:
ou do not have to learn everything in there yet, but make sure you read it entirely first and make sure you understand the slides: “comments”, “Data types | Integer types”, “Declaration”, “Characters”, “Arithmetic operators”, “Variables assignments”, “Comparisons”, “Logical operators”, “if, if…else”, “while loops”.)
